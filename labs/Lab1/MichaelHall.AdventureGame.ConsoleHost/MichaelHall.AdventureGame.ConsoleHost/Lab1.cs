//TODO make player class
//TODO make room class
//TODO make random event trigger
//TODO find syntax for C# random num gen

//story 1 - set up project

//story 2 - Intro to game, should include name, class name (ITSE 1430) and creation date of program.

//story 3 - Game loop. Create a menu. Case shouldnt matter, seperate functions for each command,
//do NOT recursively call the game loop, double check for spelling errors
//Game loop only closes when the player prompts it to end, validate user input

//story 4 - Quit command, with quit confirmation

//story 5 - Design the game world. Plan out the 3x3 grid. Only rooms adjacent to each other can be reached.

//story 6 - Moving between rooms, display current player room and confirm player positions in new rooms, player location maybe tracked by a 2d array?

//story 7 - Room descriptions, what exits are available, suggesting seperate function for each room.

//story 8 - random encounters %5 chance, function given in instructions
